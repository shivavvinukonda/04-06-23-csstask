    <p>Shikhar Dhawan (born 5 December 1985) is an Indian cricketer. A left-handed opening batsman, he captains Punjab Kings in
    the Indian Premier League and plays for Delhi in first-class cricket. At the 2013 Champions Trophy, 2015 World Cup, and
    2017 Champions Trophy, Dhawan was the leading run-scorer for India.[4] He also became the first player in the history of
    IPL to score two back-to-back centuries.[5] He was awarded the 'Player of the Tournament' for his exploits in the 2013
    ICC Champions Trophy, which he won with his national side. In the 2018 Asia Cup which Dhawan won with his national side,
    he was named Player Of The Tournament as he was the top scorer of the tournament with the bat.</p>
    <p>Dhawan made his One Day International (ODI) debut against Australia in October 2010 at Visakhapatnam. His Test debut came against the same opposition in March 2013 at Mohali, where he scored the fastest century by any batsman on Test debut and ended his innings with 187 runs from 174 balls.</P>

    <p>In August 2013, Dhawan recorded the then-second-highest individual score in a List A match when he scored 248 runs off 150 balls for India A against South Africa A at Pretoria.[8] During the 4th ODI against South Africa in Johannesburg, he became the first Indian and ninth overall to score a century in his 100th ODI game. On 14 June 2018, against Afghanistan, Dhawan became the sixth batsman, and the first for India, to score a century before lunch on day one of a Test.

      <p>World Cup through the years
The Ultimate ICC event player. Shikhar Dhawan is the individual equivalent of the Australian team post the 1999 World Cup - regardless of merit or form, he has a knack of attaining his peak form just before World events. Such was the case ahead of the 2019 World Cup, where an incredible IPL season a few months earlier made him the mainstay for the International side. Dhawan started with a bang, as he scored a sensational match-defining hundred against Australia in the group stages despite nursing a finger injury sustained during the match. That finger injury proved to be a fracture which ruled out Dhawan from the World Cup, with KL Rahul being asked to deputize as opener for the rest of the tournament. In India's 2015 World Cup campaign, Dhawan was the team’s highest run-getter with 412 runs, scoring at an average in excess of 50, with two crucial knocks in pressure games against major teams - 137 against South Africa, and a useful 73 against Pakistan.</p>
       <h2>IPl through the years</h2>
       <p>The Indian Premier League came at exactly the right time in Shikhar Dhawan's cricket career. He wasn't quite the star back then in 2008 but his credentials as a cricketer was good enough to earn him an IPL contract. Dhawan was picked up by Delhi Daredevils and he played in a star-studded team alongside Sehwag, Gambhir, de Villiers, Dilshan, and Collingwood in 2008. Shikhar batted at the vital number-3 spot and ended up as the third highest run-getter with 340 runs in 14 matches.</p>
       <p>In a bizarre decision, Delhi let Shikhar go to Mumbai in the next season. And the move to Mumbai Indians proved to be a disaster for Dhawan. In two seasons for MI, Shikhar only played 15 matches. In 2009, he played 5 matches and averaged 10 and in the next edition, he could only make 191 runs in 10 matches. After two dismal seasons, Dhawan moved to Sunrisers Hyderabad and that decision transformed Shikhar's career, he found back his consistency and became one of the key assets for Deccan Chargers first and then for Sunrisers Hyderabad. Soon, he was selected for the Indian team and since then he has been one of the top performers for India as well as for his IPL franchise.</p>
       <p>Ahead of the 2019 IPL auctions, Shikhar was traded by Sunrisers Hyderabad. They sold him to Delhi and in return got Vijay Shankar, Abhishek Sharma, and Shahbaz Nadeem. So, after a gap of 11 years, Shikhar went on to represent the Delhi franchise once again and ended the first season as the leading run getter for the Capitals, with five fifties to his name. The 2020 season was no different, in fact it proved to be better for Shikhar Dhawan as he ended as the second highest run scorer in the competition, as he scored his first IPL ton and then became the first player ever in IPL history to record back-to-back hundreds. Dhawan’s efforts helped DC reach the final, where they were beaten by arguably the best franchise side ever assembled in Mumbai Indians.</p>
       <p>In the 2021 season, Dhawan still remained the top run getter for Delhi Capitals, but his average dipped a bit and he could only manage three fifties that season. Ahead of the mega auctions, Dhawan was released with the franchise opting to retain younger players. Dhawan was the first player picked in the mega auction, with Punjab Kings raising their baton for him. He struggled to match his lofty standards in the 2022 season, as he was transitioning to become more of an anchor player. Nevertheless, he was top scorer for PBKS and he was subsequently retained and also made team captain for the next season with Mayank Agarwal being released.</p>
